"""Check whether main_admin.fct_column_profile_raw is current with the warehouse.

Returns:
  0 — profile is current; no regen needed
  1 — profile is stale; caller should regenerate

Triggers staleness when:
  - Set of (schema, table, column) keys in warehouse differs from the latest profile
  - Any tracked table's row count moved by more than 10% since its last profile

Exclusion patterns match `scripts/profile_tables.py` exactly: tables starting
with `_` (dlt internals) and tables ending with `_raw` (dlt landing tables
behind dbt views) are not profiled and therefore not checked here either.

DUCKDB_PATH is derived from the repo root so the script is portable.
